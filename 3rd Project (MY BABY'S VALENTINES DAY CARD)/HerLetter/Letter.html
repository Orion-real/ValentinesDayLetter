                HI LOVEEEEEEEE HAPPY VALENTINES DAY I know this message and this whole grand gift is a day late so I hope you can forgive me for that hehehe...
                <br><br>
                WE'RE INCHING CLOSER TO 2 YEARS NA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA it's kinda hard to believe yet here we are still going strong despite the hardships we went through... I wanted to say I. LOVE. YOU. You are seriously the most understanding and loving person I've ever met, from the moment I first saw you, something deep within me was telling myself that you were different from others.. The way you spoke, how cute you laughed, the way you smiled and giggled, your adorable sleeping face that I used to see back then.. I was already smitten with you before I was even consciously aware of it..
                <br><br>
                And now here we are na HEHEHEHHE I LOOK FORWARD SO MUCH TO WHAT WE'LL DO AND PLANS PUD FOR OUR DISTANT FUTURE.. I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE THIS GRAND GIFT OF MINE MY LOVEEEEEEE THE NEXT ONE WILL BE EVEN BETTER I PROMISE YOU THAT!!!
                <br><br>
                By yours truly
                -Eure
